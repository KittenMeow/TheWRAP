        <h1>What is Anarchism?</h1>
        <h2>A Short Guide</h2>

        <p>Within this document, I would like to do three things. Firstly, I would like to introduce what anarchism
            <em>isn’t</em>. What are anarchists against and why? The second point is to define anarchism and explain the
            basis of
            an anarchist society. What do anarchists want and how? Finally, I will do a summary of the entire document.
            <br><br>
            This document is meant to be a simple introduction to anarchism. Many people, especially those who don’t
            exactly think about politics every day, don’t want to read an essay. In that spirit, this document is not an
            essay and I will keep this as short and concise as possible. To achieve this, I’ve also added a summary at
            the end of each chapter.
        </p>

        <h1>What We're Against</h1>
        <p>Anarchists are against one main concept in today’s society: hierarchy.
        </p>

        <b>What is Hierarchy?</b>
        <p>First, I would like to define “hierarchy.”
            <br><br>
            - Hierarchy is where one person has more rights or privileges than another person. <br>
            |__ Example: Alice and Charlie are in a hierarchy. While Alice is disallowed from eating pizza, Charlie is
            allowed to eat pizza. <br>
            |__ Counter-Example: Joe and Bob are not in a hierarchy. They are both able to eat pizza freely. <br>
            - Hierarchy uses punishment (or the threat of punishment) to enforce itself. <br>
            |__ Example: If Alice is disallowed from eating pizza, but she does so anyway, she must give up some of her
            money. <br>
            |__ Counter-Example: If Joe or Bob eats pizza, they are not scared of doing so and they will not be
            punished for
            it.
            <br><br>
            Some more serious examples of hierarchy include patriarchy, queerphobia and racism.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, the government is a hierarchy. If Bob decides to work in government, he will have more
            privileges than the ordinary person, such as making laws. If Alice breaks one of those laws, she will be
            punished by the government.
            <br><br>
            Another form of hierarchy is capitalism. Capitalism is about profit generation. The point of a capitalistic
            society is for companies to make money for their bosses. This is a hierarchy because more money allows for
            more ability to do things. If you refuse to work under capitalism, you are punished with poverty.
        </p>

        <b>Being Against Hierarchy</b>
        <p>Anarchists are against hierarchy because it forces people to adhere to a system of domination, or else be
            punished.
            <br><br>
            Since patriarchy allows men to be in a position of power over others, and it will punish anyone who steps
            out of line, anarchists oppose it.
            <br><br>
            Government allows some to dominate others by telling people what they can and cannot do, punishes people who
            break those laws, and forces everyone to adhere to it, so anarchists oppose it.
            <br><br>
            Capitalism permits the rich to have more ability to buy and make things, while others have to work for them
            or else go into poverty, and so anarchists oppose it.
        </p>

        <b>Summary</b>
        <p>- Hierarchy involves domination and use/threat of punishment.<br>
            - Queerphobia, racism, sexism, capitalism, and government are all forms of hierarchy.<br>
            - Anarchists oppose hierarchy because it forces adherence, and those who don’t follow a hierarchy risk being
            punished. This system is coercive.<br>
        </p>

        <h1>What We're For</h1>
        <p>Anarchism isn’t one political ideology, but many. This document will try to explain collective anarchism
            (rather than individual anarchism) in the most general terms.
        </p>

        <b>Bottom-Up Decision Making</b>
        <p>Anarchist societies would be built from the bottom-up. There is a lot of debate on the exact details of this,
            but one common idea is a consensus process.
            <br><br>
            Individuals within a community would come together and agree or disagree.
            <br><br>
            - If everyone agrees, then the community would be okay with going forwards. <br>
            - If almost everyone agrees, but a few disagree, the community could continue if the few don’t disagree
            enough
            to block it. <br>
            - If anyone blocks it, then the community would not continue. If the community decides to continue anyways,
            the person could leave the community or continue to fight the decision.<br>
            |__ This would be a strong moral opposition to something. It wouldn’t be used lightly.<br>
        </p>

        <b>"Enforcement"</b>
        <p>The “enforcement” of any decisions would be done by social pressure. I put “enforcement” in quotes because it
            wouldn’t be mandatory. Instead, any projects carried out or decisions made by the community would be
            supported by the consensus. Anyone who disagrees would not be bound by any law, but by societal pressure.
        </p>

        <b>Large-Scale Anarchism</b>
        <p>One common argument against anarchism is, “That’s great and all, but it would never work on a large scale.” I
            would say that this argument is a misconception about what anarchism is.
            <br><br>
            If a single anarchist community had 300 million people, that would be infeasible. Instead, anarchist
            communities would be split up into interconnected yet separated communities, similar to a confederation.
            <br><br>
            These communities would likely be very small, possibly neighborhood size. This is so that the consensus
            process can function properly.
        </p>

        <b>Isn't That A Government?</b>
        <p>The communities model and the consensus model aren’t the only model for anarchism. An anarchist community’s
            very first action would be to decide on their model for decision-making and for how they will be organized.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, the government is a hierarchy. Under anarchism, nobody would have more power than another to
            do something. Also, it does not force adherence. Instead, it heavily suggests that decisions be followed and
            if they aren’t, then society will react accordingly.
        </p>

        <b>Summary</b>
        <p>- Anarchist communities use a consensus-type model for decision making and deciding on projects.<br>
            - “Enforcement” of these decisions would be done by societal pressure.<br>
            - Each community would be very small, being interconnected yet separate.<br>
            - This is not the only model, but it is a common model.<br>
        </p>

        <h1>Overall Summary</h1>
        <b>What We're Against</b>
        <p>Anarchists are against hierarchy (where someone gets more privileges or rights than another) due to its
            nature in using domination, with the threat of a punishment.
            <br><br>
            Government, capitalism, queerphobia, the patriarchy, etc., all fall under the idea of hierarchy.
        </p>
        <b>What We're For</b>
        <p>Anarchist societies would be built from the bottom-up, with many different models.
            <br><br>
            I describe a model of decision-making using consensus, where you can agree, disagree, or block a proposal.
            <br><br>
            “Enforcement” is done via societal expectations and pressure rather than punishment.
            <br><br>
            Anarchism, under this model, would be split up into many tiny, interconnected but separate communities.
        </p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading! Anarchism, just like any other political system, is
            quite difficult to describe and there is a lot more nuance than shown in this document. I just talked about
            the basics. Any future questions can be answered at dakotapercy35@gmail.com or by messaging me on social
            media.
            <br><br>
            Thank you,<br>
            Autumn.
